This is a Python Flask App

All paths are linux paths, so it is ideal if the app is run on a linux environment.

Before running the following the installation of the following modules is required:
pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install sqlalchemy-migrate
pip install distance

Once the above have been installed run: ./db_migrate

That's it.

WARMUP script
SQLITE sometimes hangs the first couple of runs on a new system inspite of migration. To simplify this
run the warmup script. If the script hasn't returned in 1 minute or so, force terminate (Ctrl-Z) the script
and rerun. Once it returns a success message you may start the app.

To app runner is present in run.py
./run.py 
to start the app. 
Type localhost:8000/ on your browser

In case you want to vary the port, you can modify it within run.py
