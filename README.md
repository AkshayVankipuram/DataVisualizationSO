This is a Python Flask App written as part of a class project to create a visual recommendation service based on a public StackOverflow dataset. The web application uses [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to generate user specific visualizations that serve as recommendations. At its core, we created several topic models based on the SO dataset and the recommendation service leverages this.

We used [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) to perform topic modeling as provided by the [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) package.

Python Dependencies: flask, flask-sqlalchemy, sqlalchemy-migrate, distance

It is not in a runnable state at the moment.
